* ~asciinema-player~'s assets

  Here there are the [[https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player][asciinema-player]]'s assets i.e. the following
  files:

  - ~asciinema-player.js~
  - ~asciinema-player.css~

  I've had to create this repository since, unluckily, the official
  repository don't release these files in a tarball, so I can't use
  them as flake's ~input~ in my [[https://github.com/aciceri/blog/][blog]].
  This is just a workaround, not a permanent solution.
